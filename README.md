# click-tracker
total number of times you clicked button,
 First, create an HTML page with two
buttons. The first button, when clicked, adds one to a variable that keeps track of the number of
clicks. The second button, when clicked, uses an alert() to let the user know how many times the
first button was clicked. The message should say “You clicked x times.” where “x” is the number
of times the first button was clicked. All the JS code should be placed in an external file and
included at the end of the <body> tag.
